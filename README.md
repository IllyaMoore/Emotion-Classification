# Emotion Classification Project

A machine learning project for classifying emotions using text data and LSTM neural networks.

## Project Overview

This project implements emotion classification using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to recognize and classify different emotional states from text input using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.

## Features

- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- LSTM-based neural network architecture
- Data splitting and preparation workflows
- Model training and evaluation
- Support for multiple emotion classes

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

- **Data Processing**: Raw data handling and preprocessing
- **Model Training**: LSTM model implementation and training scripts
- **Analysis**: Data analysis and visualization notebooks
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and tokenization tools

## Dataset

The project uses emotion classification datasets with text samples labeled with corresponding emotional categories.

## Model Architecture
